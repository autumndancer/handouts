Creating a Handout
Why create a handout this way?
For the most useful, longest-enduring handouts, let's follow some best practices:
Take a consistent approach, for a standardized look.  The visual identity of a handout reinforces that we know what we're doing.
A team approach results in highest buy-in and reduces nasty surprises by building in review.
People can easily let a handout project languish.  Setting a timeline, including interim dates, helps get the project done.

Elements of a handout project
1--
Develop clear statements of Purpose, Audience, and Scope.
Examples:

2--
Set up a team, ideally with three members:
content developer (originator); 
“reader” (student viewpoint); 
checker (content, format, links).

3--Set a timeline, with rough dates for these 7 steps:
1st draft to reader, reader comments done,
2nd draft to checker, checker comments done, 
send final to supervisor, final comments done, 
create output (send to print or upload to Ro for web).

4--
Use the Word template for handouts.  It is accessible and includes defined styles, page margins, headers, footers, and a consistently-placed logo.
In Handouts\Template\About, open Template.docx and save it as your new handout name---no, we want people to put it in GitHub, right?

5--
Add your content.  Using the template will allow you to modify the template content.  Sections include title, Why?, the body of the content, examples, and a list of sources or further info.

6--
Get your content reviewed, as arranged in the timeline (step 3).

7--
Create output, either print or electronic.
